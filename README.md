FiMfic-Story-DL
===============

Firefox extension, tested on Firefox 26-29.
Adds an icon on story pages in fimfiction.net. When clicked, it compiles all chapters into a single html file (along with some HTML overhead) for downloading convenience.

To install, download StoryDL.xpi and drag it into a Firefox window.
The HTML overhead can be changed in the extension options.
